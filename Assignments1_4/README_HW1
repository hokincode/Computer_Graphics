HW1

So homework 1, I think there are two parts. First is about the simple operations on images. Then, I think morphing and warping are kind of hard. For adding random noise, brightening, luminance, contrast, saturation, I think it's not that hard since I think I just followed what is taught in the class and everything is good. Since, luminance, brightening, and random noise are really single pixel operation, so I just used an iterator to do the task. For contrast, I used an iterator to first calculate the luminance_summation and then I used the second iterator to do the pixel wise operation. Quantizing is a bit hard, as you need to follow the procedures on the power slides exactly, which take me some time to debug. The sampling method is tricky in the sense that you really need to calculate where are they. Otherwise, everything else is easy. For edge detection and blurring, I just used the simple methods and rather than complicating things, I used straight forward coding writing that I think everyone is able to understand. The problem for warping and morphing is, the code was orginally working fine on my personal Apple Unix machine, but failed on the Linux school machine. I don't know why there is such discrepancy. But I think my code tells straigh fowardlly my design for the problem.
